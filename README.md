## Project Specific Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- For use of SQL Server you may have to create a user called `root` and then create the `dev` database manually. 
- You will also have to turn on the TCP/IP options in the protocols for your local instance of SQL server [See here](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/2133) Or [here](http://127.0.0.1:63343/help/db-tutorial-connecting-to-ms-sql-server.html)
- To use migrations for you will need to follow the directions [here](https://typeorm.io/#/using-cli/installing-cli)

Run `cd qa; npm install; npm run dev;` to run the API and UI at the same time on first pull of Repo

## Database Instructions

Using nest js and TypeOrm required a bit of massaging found this reasource to get this working [here](https://github.com/ambroiseRabier/typeorm-nestjs-migration-example)

Main Content From : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ambroiseRabier/typeorm-nestjs-migration-example/master/README.md

#### Usage
1. `npm run typeorm:migrate <myEntity-migration>`
2. Check your migration queries in `src/migrations`
3. `npm run start:dev` or `npm run start:prod` or `npm run typeorm:run`

If everything went well, you have up to date entites and a `migrations` table listing applied migrations.

#### Additional information
- If you set `migrationsRun` to false in ormconfig.ts, you will have to use `npm run typeorm:run` to apply the migration, otherwise all migrations are applied automatically at application start.
- If you do not set `--config` parameter typeorm seek a valid configuration file at the root of the project.
- You do not want `ormconfig.ts` at the root of the project, otherwise it change /dist structure, you would have to change `start:prod: node dist/main.js` to `start:prod: node dist/src/main.js`.

## Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

Below are some plugins which you can add to your workspace:

- [Angular](https://angular.io)
  - `ng add @nrwl/angular`
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
  - `ng add @nrwl/react`
- Web (no framework frontends)
  - `ng add @nrwl/web`
- [Nest](https://nestjs.com)
  - `ng add @nrwl/nest`
- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
  - `ng add @nrwl/express`
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
  - `ng add @nrwl/node`

## Generate an application

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are sharable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@qa/mylib`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng g component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

## Build

Run `ng build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
